# TeamMatch

## Introduction

This simple application is built using ReactJS and allows an organization to filter its employees based on their skills and experience to select the right team for a project. The employees are grouped based on their teams and the user can expand or collapse each group to view the details of the employees. The project uses hooks and functional components to manipulate and display data, and it is easily scalable.
