# TeamMatch

## Introduction

This simple application is built using ReactJS, Express, MongoDB and JWT auth that allows an organization to filter its employees based on their skills and experience to select the right team for a project. The employees are grouped based on their teams and the user can expand or collapse each group to view the details of the employees. The project uses hooks and functional components to manipulate and display data, and it is easily scalable. Note that this is just a boilerplate/start-point for some much bigger and complex applications that can be built using the same tech stack.
